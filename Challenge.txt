Overview of Challenge 
Show you can access and manipulate Parquet and Arrow files from Golang. 
You will learn the power and limitations of Apache Arrow 
You will learn when to use Parquet and Arrow 

While we are proposing a Challenge the developer can create their own requirements. The simplest way is to prove that you can use Apache Arrow Flight with Golang. 
Apache Arrow Flight deals with the transmission of fragments of Apache Arrow data over gRPC 

One Challenge 
Write a gRPC server to read and write Apache Arrow and Parquet files
Your Arrow file is as simple as a an invoice_line_item table that contains the following fields 
    date: Timestamp
    account: Integer → a account identifier 
    product: Integer → a product identifier 
    quantity: Float → how many units of the product is sold to an account 
    price: Float → what is the total price for the products sold to the account 
You will receive a invoice line items in batch format via Parquet
You will have clients that get statistics on the Arrow file. The idea is not any super complicated computation. We just want to see how you can have many users in scale read arrow files.
